You must have Node and NPM installed on your computer to install run the following command 

`npm i -g dplyr-cli` or if you are using Yarn you can run `yarn global add dplyr-cli`

To test your installition run `dplyr` and you should have a help output if the installtion is correct

After that you will be able to excute commands from our CLI.
